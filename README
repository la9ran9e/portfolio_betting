This repository dedicated to portfolio betting on spread of goals. It helps to bet on EPL nearest matches which odds published on http://www.sportingindex.com - the only site providing odds for spread betting I have managed to find.
Statistics of matches collected from the season 2009-2010 from http://int.soccerway.com.
You already can start betting_part using start.sh and see a results before next round in EPL. Current statistics is up to 22.01.2017.
1. Cuurent version just allows portfolio with a minimal risk, but I intend to improve the code to show a full range of available portfolios.
2. This is a realy bad code because I write this very fast and didn't read needed manuals. I also improve some fragments (the major drawback is building a table of full posibility without using the tree traversal algorithm - probable cause of only posible portfolio interval from 2 to 4, with tree traversal algorithm it may be wider).
3. This scripts use selenium library for Chrome and Tor. You should install it (but likely this fragments of code are also not perfect).
4. Updating of statistics module is needed.
